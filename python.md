## Introduction

This tutorial will teach you how to setup and use the Syntacts Python API. 
You should have first built and installed the Syntacts library to your system. 
For this tutorial we will use [Idle](https://cmake.org/) to manage our project and build. 
However, the process should be similar if you are using an IDE such as Visual Studio or Xcode.
