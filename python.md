## Introduction

This tutorial will teach you how to setup and use the Syntacts Python API. 
You should have first built and installed the Syntacts library to your system. 
For this tutorial we will use IDLE to edit and manage our project. 
However, the process should be similar if you are using another IDE such as PyCharm.

## Requirements

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) interpreter

## Basic Setup

- If you haven't already, [build and install](building.md) Syntacts.
- Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) on your device if it is not already installed.
- Create a new script in the same directory as `syntacts.py` and the dII.
- In the script, include the following commands:

```python
from syntacts import *
from time import sleep
from math import sin
from math import pi
```
