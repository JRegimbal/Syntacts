Syntacts is a haptic rendering framework for **vibrotactile feedback**. It eliminates the need for expensive haptic controllers or custom electronics by leveraging commercial-off-the-shelf **audio interfaces**. As a complete package, Syntacts provides the software and hardware needed to interface audio devices with low latency, synthesize complex waveforms, and amplify signals to appropriate levels.

# Software

Whether itâ€™s the audio jack on your laptop or a high-end multi-channel sound card, Syntacts gives you the ability to connect to virtually any audio device. From there, you can load or procedurally generate vibrational waveforms and play them in real-time on any number of outputs. Programming APIs are provided for **C/C++, C#, Python, and Unity**, and a responsive GUI lets you design, visualize, and play cues with ease.

# Hardware

Whereas Syntacts software handles getting waveforms from your application to your audio device, the **Syntacts amplifier** transmits signals from your audio device to your actuators. With fully differential inputs and outputs and a linear architecture, the Syntacts amplifier is purpose-built for driving high-density tactile arrays with minimal noise.
