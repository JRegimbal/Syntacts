### What does the name Syntacts mean?
- The definition for *syntax* is:
  > the arrangement of words and phrases to create well-formed sentences in a language
  
  Similarly, Syntacts deals with the arrangement primitive waveforms to create expressive vibrations and tactile cues.
- The portmanteau of "**syn**thesizer" and "**tact**or"

### Can I use the Syntacts software and/or hardware in my project? 
- Yes, of course! All software is licensed under the [MIT License](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License). All hardware is licensed under the [TAPR Open Hardware License](https://tapr.org/the-tapr-open-hardware-license/). 

### How can I cite Syntacts in my research?
- We currently have a Transactions on Haptics short paper in review. Please check back later!

### How can I get involved?
- The easiest way to get involved is to head over to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/mahilab/Syntacts). Here, you can submit a new issue or feature request. Better yet, consider submitting a pull request that fixes a problem you found in Syntacts or adds a cool new feature!
- Did you modify our designs or create a device that uses Syntacts? Consider sharing them on this website!

### Do I need the Syntacts software to use the Syntacts amplifier, and vice versa?
- No, they are independent! You can use the software with your own amplifiers, or our amplifiers with your own software.

### Can Syntacts be used for mobile haptic applications?
- Syntacts software is primarily intended for desktop based research and requires an audio device and host PC to function. It may be possible to use a laptop and battery powered audio interface to make your project mobile. Syntacts has not been tested on embedded operating systems, but it may be possible -- let us know! 
- Syntacts amplifiers can be powered with three AA batteries in series, so they can be integrated with mobile applications easily.

### When running Syntacts software, I get a `VCRUNTIME140.dll missing` message or similar.
