## Introduction

In this tutorial, we will create a GUI interface that allows us to "draw" 2D tactile animations on the 24-tactor [Syntacts Array](/hardware). We will leverage Syntact's Spatializer to blend the amplitudes of adjacent tactors so that we can create the illusion of continuous motion. The program will be written in C++ using the [mahi-gui](https://github.com/mahilab/mahi-gui) library. The Syntacts Array is driven by a MOTU 24Ao audio interface. Even if you don't have a MOTU 24Ao or the array, this tutorial is still a good example of creating user interfaces around Syntacts.
