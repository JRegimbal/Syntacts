The Syntacts amplifier is a purpose built, 8-channel amplifier designed for driving vibrotactors from audio sources. The amp uses eight fully differential, Class AB `TI-TPA6211A1-Q1` power amplifiers for a completely noise free operation. Two variants are available: one with an AES-59 DB25 input, great for connecting to high-end devices like the MOTU 24Ao; and one with four 3.5 mm phone inputs, perfect for use with generic audio output or surround sound cards. Both require a 5V power supply and output amplified signal through a universal 2x8 0.1" ptich header. The amp will drive loads greater than 3 ohms, and we have successfully tested it with a vairety of LRAs from [Digikey](https://www.digikey.com/products/en/motors-solenoids-driver-boards-modules/motors-ac-dc/178?k=&pkeyword=&sv=0&pv110=419682&sf=0&FV=-8%7C178&quantity=&ColumnSort=0&page=1&pageSize=25), EAI's [C2 and C3](https://www.eaiinfo.com/tactor-info) voice coil actuators, and Nanoport's [TacHammer](https://nanoport.io/haptics/) actuators.

CAD/EDA files, bill of materials, and documentation for both variants can be found below. The files have been formated so that you can upload or send them directly to your favorite board house. Need a recommendation? We have used [Sunstone Circuits](https://www.sunstone.com/) for basic PCB printing, and both [Sierra Circuits](https://www.protoexpress.com/) and [Screaming Circuits](https://www.screamingcircuits.com/) for turn-key printing and assembly with great results.
