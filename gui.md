## Introduction

This tutorial will teach you how to setup and use the Syntacts GUI. This will allow you to create, visualize, and sequence cues for your desired use.

## Requirements

- Latest [Syntacts release](https://github.com/mahilab/Syntacts/releases)

## Basic Setup

- Download the [latest pre-compiled Syntacts binaries](https://github.com/mahilab/Syntacts/releases) for your system and extract the files. 
- Run the GUI executable `syntacts-gui` in the top level directory. 
- On Windows, you may receive a “Windows protected your PC” screen. Click “More info”, then “Run anyway”.
- On macOS, the executable `syntacts-gui` may not run, and it will instead open the binary code. If this occurs, run the following command in a Terminal in the directory of the Syntacts binaries. After this, you will be able to successfully run `syntacts-gui`.

```shell
> sudo chmod 777 syntacts-gui
```
